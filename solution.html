        <h1>I propose that we put fans and frozen oxygen cubes everywhere. Think about it. People buy fans to keep themselves and their loved ones cool during the searing temperatures of the Vegas heat. With fans everywhere, it would cool everything down, as with the oxygen cubes.</h1>
        <h1>Oxygen has a melting point of -361.8 degrees fahrenheit. With this, the cold oxygen vapors emitting from the cubes would cool everything down along with producing oxygen for the environment.</h1>
